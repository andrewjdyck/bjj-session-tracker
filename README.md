# BJJ Training Session Tracker

This project is an experiment in building (and learning how to build) a React.js webapp to track my BJJ training sessions over time and my overall progress. Inspired by the now non-functional mattime.io.

# Background

1. Who is this app for?
    - People who want to track and develop their Jiu Jitsu training
2. What problem does this solve?
    - Easy way for Jiu Jitsu athletes to enter and visualize their training progress in the sport. Without this app, users would need to develop their own spreadsheets, know how to enter the information into it properly, and visualize it.



# Release plan

## Upcoming features

- Limit session return to last 20 sessions on home page
- User profile (rank, club, age, weight, etc.)
- Update firebase security rules
- Ensure user signin works properly
- BUGS
    - Menu button shows "loading..." when not logged in. No message when login fails
    - Menu button move to top-right
    - Align view/edit sessions appropriately
    - Ensure firebase connection is corrected.

- FIRST RELEASE!!
    - Use prod database
    - Ability to work on dev branch with dev db

- Pagination for sessions.
- Session import/export
