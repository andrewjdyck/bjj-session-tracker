# BJJ Training Session Tracker

This project is an experiment in building (and learning how to build) a React.js webapp to track my BJJ training sessions over time and my overall progress. Inspired by the now non-functional mattime.io.

# Background

1. Who is this app for?
    - People who want to track and develop their Jiu Jitsu training
2. What problem does this solve?
    - Easy way for Jiu Jitsu athletes to enter and visualize their training progress in the sport. Without this app, users would need to develop their own spreadsheets, know how to enter the information into it properly, and visualize it.
