# BJJ Training Session Tracker

This project is an experiment in building (and learning how to build) a React.js webapp to track my BJJ training sessions over time and my overall progress. Inspired by the now non-functional mattime.io.

## Upcoming features

- Limit session return to last 20 sessions on home page
- User profile (rank, club, age, weight, etc.)
- BUGS
    - Menu button shows "loading..." when not logged in. No message when login fails
    - Menu button move to top-right
    - Align view/edit sessions appropriately
    - Ensure firebase connection is corrected.
- First release!
- Better styling and layout - replace bootstrap with something better like tailwind
- Pagination for sessions.
- Session import/export
