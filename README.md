# BJJ Training Session Tracker

This project is an experiment in building (and learning how to build) a React.js webapp to track my BJJ training sessions over time and my overall progress. Inspired by the now non-functional mattime.io.

## Upcoming features

- Pagination for sessions.
- Styling and layout
- First release!
- modal for session editing
- User profile (rank, club, age, weight, etc.)
- Session import/export
